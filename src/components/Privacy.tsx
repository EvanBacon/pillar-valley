      <p>
        Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our web site services,
        you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help
        you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do
        with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it
        carefully.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information to provide better services to all our users. We
        collect information in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Information you give us. For example, our services require you to sign
          up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information,
          like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information we get from your use of our services. We collect
          information about the services that you use and how you use them, like
          when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you
          view and interact with our ads and content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide,
        maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect
        our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content –
        like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>Transparency and Choice</h2>
      <p>
        People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about
        what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices
        about how it is used.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>Information You Share</h2>
      <p>
        Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember
        that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search
        engines.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>
        Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information
      </h2>
      <p>
        Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your
        personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give
        you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep
        that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>Information We Share</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and
        individuals outside of our company unless one of the following
        circumstances applies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>With your consent</li>
        <li>For external processing</li>
        <li>For legal reasons</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>Security of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or
        unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we
        hold.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>When This Privacy Policy Applies</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by our company
        and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as
        our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate
        privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>
        Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities
      </h2>
      <p>
        We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also
        adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks.
      </p>
      <h2 style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your
        rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will
        post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are
        significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for
        certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
